3.1. Revenue Model
3.1.1. Customization fee for specific university

3.2. Market Opportunity
The prominent E-learning trend in the world brings large market opportunities for online learning management system. In 2016, the National University of Singapore alone has a total enrollment of 38,596 students. Similarly, with the increasing number of people receiving higher education today, a flexible and convenient corporate learning environment becomes important for different universities. Additionally, with a large number of lecturers and teaching assistants involved, our system, LHS should have a prominent target customer group. Besides, since we provide customization and maintenance of the system for the customer, LHS is also suitable for different

educational institutions who intend to develop online learning system for their students.
3.3. Competitive Environment
As we provide our product to education institutions, our main competitors are the learning systems self-developed by technical teams in different educational institutions. The advantage of a self-developed integrated learning environment for internal use is, the education institution could implement some functions and features that satisfy their specific requirements. In addition, the education institution could make an adjustment or conduct the maintenance of their system at any time.
Some other competitors are companies that design and develop customized enterprise resource system for institutions. This kind of ERPs is usually more systematic and secure, while more expensive and difficult to perform adjustment or maintenance, as institutions have to pay additional fees or take more time to get familiar with the design and structure by themselves.
3.4. Competitive Advantage
3.4.1. Multiple User Role
Compared with the existing integrated learning environment, Learning Hub is an integrated system combining different user roles such as administrators, lecturers, teaching assistants, and students to contribute, upload and share learning resources. Learning Hub could easily help the universities to develop new roles.

3.4.2. Multi-Platform
Learning Hub enables users to access using multi-platform devices such as personal computers and mobile phones. The website of Learning Hub is mobile-friendly so that users could access the website when they use their personal computers and mobile phones. Besides, the mobile application of Learning Hub is also developed to better cater users’ preferences to access data anytime, anywhere.
3.4.3. Time Management
The time management subsystem, which includes the monthly schedule, weekly schedule and daily schedule on the website, could offer the users an intuitive way to manage their time entries and improve the productivity and efficiency of the students and the lecturers.
3.4.4. Administrator Management
The administrator management system could help the managers of the Learning Hub to better manage the users, modules rather than manually check the information in the database. Also, the administrator could easily assign modules to lecturers or teaching assistants.
3.5. Marketing and Advertising Strategies
We plan to adopt a two-pronged marketing and advertising strategies: Targeting, Positioning and Messaging.

3.5.1. Targeting
By filtering schools with the need to adopt new integrated learning system and schools that currently do not have an existing system, this could greatly increase the chance of successful adoption of Learning Hub System by targeted institutions. How we are going to attract potentially interested institutions is through mass media marketing such as outdoor advertisements, business directories and infomercials, direct marketing such as emailing to school IT infrastructure division, and digital marketing through social media (Facebook or Twitter) and YouTube channel.
3.5.2. Positioning
Positioning is the step where we define the image of Learning Hub System. The branding process takes user needs, LHS key features as well as competitors’ products into account to set our offering apart from similar products in the market. For example, with Arts Institution, we will highlight aesthetic user interface as compared to competitors offering, while with institution containing a large number of users, we will feature on the capability of allowing users with different roles to collaborate on the integrated system.
